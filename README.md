# Biostatistics Mastery Portfolio

This repository documents a structured 24-month journey in **methodological biostatistics**, designed to build deep expertise in statistical theory, computational modeling, and public health data science. It integrates rigorous training in **foundational mathematics** (linear algebra, calculus, probability, and optimization), **statistical inference**, and **Bayesian methods**, with reproducible workflows in R and Python.

The portfolio follows a week-by-week implementation plan across eight phases, including:

- Mathematical and computational foundations for statistical modeling
- Statistical thinking in public health contexts
- Bayesian computation and hierarchical modeling
- Core biostatistics curriculum (inference, regression, survival analysis)
- Longitudinal and mixed models with diagnostic workflows
- Machine learning for health outcomes and causal inference
- Specialization tracks in clinical trials or genomics
- Integration projects showcasing methodological depth and reproducibility

Each folder in this repository reflects a key component of the training pipeline:

- `01_foundations/` — Exercises and notes on mathematical foundations and R programming
- `02_projects/` — Applied and methodological projects with reproducible code and public health datasets
- `03_notes/` — Conceptual write-ups on statistical methods, epidemiology, and modeling strategies
- `04_cheatsheets/` — Quick references for Git, R, modeling workflows, and reproducibility tools

## Mission Statement

This portfolio is designed as a structured training and research environment in methodological biostatistics. It documents a 24‑month progression through mathematical foundations, statistical theory, and applied public health data analysis, with a consistent emphasis on reproducibility and methodological rigor.

The repository serves three purposes:

- **Graduate‑level preparation** — consolidating advanced mathematical and computational skills to support formal coursework in biostatistics.  
- **Research development** — building a portfolio of projects that highlight methodological contributions in areas such as Bayesian modeling, survival analysis, longitudinal data methods, and machine learning for health.  
- **Scholarly communication** — demonstrating clarity in documentation, transparency in workflow, and interdisciplinary impact through reproducible code and explanatory notes.  

By integrating foundational exercises, applied projects, and methodological notes, this portfolio reflects a commitment to advancing biostatistics not only as a tool for application but as a discipline of methodological innovation.
